These directories contain files that are to be added to the corresponding
directories in the project hierarchy. You should be able to just copy or
move them from here into the correct places:

   cp inc/* ../../inc
   cp kern/* ../../kern
   cp lib/* ../../lib
   cp user/* ../../user

You can, if you prefer, use the COPY script found here, which will
iterate through the files to be updated and check to be sure they don't
already exist before copying them, to avoid accidentally overwriting
them.
